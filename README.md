## orthologous maps - evolutionary age index

[`orthomap`](https://github.com/kullrich/orthomap) is a python package to extract orthologous maps
(in other words the evolutionary age of a given orthologous group) from OrthoFinder or eggNOG results.
Orthomap results (gene ages per orthogroup) can be further used to calculate and visualize weighted expression data
(transcriptome evolutionary index) from scRNA sequencing objects.

## Documentation

Online documentation can be found [here](https://orthomap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Installing `orthomap`

More installation options can be found [here](https://orthomap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/index.html).

### orthomap installation using conda and pip

We recommend installing `orthomap` in an independent conda environment to avoid dependent software conflicts.
Please make a new python environment for `orthomap` and install dependent libraries in it.

If you do not have a working installation of Python 3.8 (or later),
consider installing [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) or
[Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

To create and activate the environment run:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/kullrich/orthomap.git
$ cd orthomap
$ conda env create --file environment.yml
$ conda activate orthomap_env
```

Then to install `orthomap` via PyPI:

```shell
$ pip install orthomap
```

## Quick usage

Detailed tutorials how to use `orthomap` can be found [here](https://orthomap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/index.html).

### Update/download local ncbi taxonomic database:

The following command downloads or updates your local copy of the
NCBI's taxonomy database (~300MB). The database is saved at
`~/.etetoolkit/taxa.sqlite`.

```python
>>> from orthomap import ncbitax
>>> ncbitax.update_ncbi()
```

### Step 1 - Get query species taxonomic lineage information:

You can query a species lineage information based on its name or its
taxID. For example `Danio rerio` with taxID `7955`:

```python
>>> from orthomap import qlin
>>> qlin.get_qlin(q = 'Danio rerio')
>>> qlin.get_qlin(qt = '7955')
```

You can get the query species topology as a tree.
For example for `Danio rerio` with taxID `7955`:

```python
>>> from orthomap import qlin
>>> query_topology = qlin.get_lineage_topo(qt = '7955')
>>> query_topology.write()
```

### Step 2 - Get query species orthomap from OrthoFinder results:

The following code extracts the `orthomap` for `Danio rerio` based on pre-calculated 
OrthoFinder results and ensembl release-105:

OrthoFinder results (-S diamond_ultra_sens) using translated, longest-isoform coding sequences
from ensembl release-105 have been archived and can be found
[here](https://zenodo.org/record/7242264#.Y1p19i0Rowc).

```python
>>> from orthomap import datasets, of2orthomap
>>> datasets.ensembl105(datapath='.')
>>> query_orthomap = of2orthomap.get_orthomap(
...     seqname='Danio_rerio.GRCz11.cds.longest',
...     qt='7955',
...     sl='ensembl_105_orthofinder_species_list.tsv',
...     oc='ensembl_105_orthofinder_Orthogroups.GeneCount.tsv',
...     og='ensembl_105_orthofinder_Orthogroups.tsv',
...     out=None, quiet=False, continuity=True, overwrite=True)
>>> query_orthomap
```

### Step 3 - Map OrthoFinder gene names and scRNA gene/transcript names:

The following code extracts the gene to transcript table for `Danio rerio`:

GTF file obtained from [here](https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-105/gtf/danio_rerio/Danio_rerio.GRCz11.105.gtf.gz).

```python
>>> from orthomap import datasets, gtf2t2g
>>> gtf_file = datasets.zebrafish_gtf(datapath='.')
>>> query_species_t2g = gtf2t2g.parse_gtf(
...     gtf=gtf_file,
...     g=True, b=True, p=True, v=True, s=True, q=True)
>>> query_species_t2g
```

Import now, the scRNA dataset of the query species.

example: **Danio rerio** - [http://tome.gs.washington.edu](http://tome.gs.washington.edu)
([Qui et al. 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-022-01018-x))

`AnnData` file can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7243602).

```python
>>> import scanpy as sc
>>> from orthomap import datasets, orthomap2tei
>>> # download zebrafish scRNA data here: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7243602
>>> # or download with datasets.qiu22_zebrafish(datapath='.')
>>> zebrafish_data = datasets.qiu22_zebrafish(datapath='.')
>>> zebrafish_data
>>> # check overlap of transcript table <gene_id> and scRNA data <var_names>
>>> orthomap2tei.geneset_overlap(zebrafish_data.var_names, query_species_t2g['gene_id'])
```

The `replace_by` helper function can be used to add a new column to the `orthomap` dataframe by matching e.g.
gene isoform names and their corresponding gene names.

```python
>>> # convert orthomap transcript IDs into GeneIDs and add them to orthomap
>>> query_orthomap['geneID'] = orthomap2tei.replace_by(
...    x_orig = query_orthomap['seqID'],
...    xmatch = query_species_t2g['transcript_id_version'],
...    xreplace = query_species_t2g['gene_id'])
>>> # check overlap of orthomap <geneID> and scRNA data
>>> orthomap2tei.geneset_overlap(zebrafish_data.var_names, query_orthomap['geneID'])
```

### Step 4 - Get transcriptome evolutionary index (TEI) values and add them to scRNA dataset:

Since now the gene names correspond to each other in the `orthomap` and the scRNA adata object,
one can calculate the transcriptome evolutionary index (TEI) and add them to the scRNA dataset (adata object).

```python
>>> # add TEI values to existing adata object
>>> orthomap2tei.get_tei(adata=zebrafish_data,
...    gene_id=query_orthomap['geneID'],
...    gene_age=query_orthomap['PSnum'],
...    keep='min',
...    layer=None,
...    add=True,
...    obs_name='tei',
...    boot=False,
...    bt=10,
...    normalize_total=False,
...    log1p=False,
...    target_sum=1e6)
```

### Step 5 - Downstream analysis

Once the gene age data has been added to the scRNA dataset,
one can e.g. plot the corresponding transcriptome evolutionary index (TEI) values
by any given observation pre-defined in the scRNA dataset.

#### Boxplot TEI per stage:

```python
>>>sc.pl.violin(adata=zebrafish_data,
...             keys=['tei'],
...             groupby='stage',
...             rotation=90,
...             palette='Paired',
...             stripplot=False,
...             inner='box')
```

## orthomap via Command Line

`orthomap` can also be used via the command line.
