Install orthomap
----------------

Python Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- orthomap was developed using Python `3.8`. We do not support Python `2.7x` or Python `<=3.7`.

orthomap installation using conda and pip
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  We recommend installing orthomap in an independent conda environment to avoid dependent software conflicts.
  Please make a new python environment for orthomap and install dependent libraries in it.

  The environment is created with `conda create` in which orthomap is installed.

  If you do not have a working installation of Python `3.8` (or later), consider
  installing `Anaconda <https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/>`_ or `Miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_. Then run:

  ::

      git clone https://github.com/kullrich/orthomap.git
      cd orthomap
      conda env create --file environment.yml
      conda activate orthomap_env

  Install `orthomap` via `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/orthomap>`_:

  ::

      pip install orthomap

Development Version
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To work with the latest version `on GitHub <https://github.com/kullrich/orthomap>`_: clone the repository and `cd` into its root directory.

  ::

      git clone kullrich/orthomap
      cd orthomap

Install `orthomap` into your current python environment:

  ::

      pip install .

Installing Miniconda
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After downloading `Miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_, in a unix shell (Linux, Mac), run

  ::

      cd DOWNLOAD_DIR
      chmod +x Miniconda3-latest-VERSION.sh
      ./Miniconda3-latest-VERSION.sh
